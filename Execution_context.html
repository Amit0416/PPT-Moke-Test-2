<!-- 1.Global Execution Context:-   The global execution context is the default context
 that is created when the script is initially loaded. It represents the global
  scope and contains all global variables, functions, and objects. It is the 
  outermost context in the execution stack.


2.Function Execution Context:-   Whenever a function is invoked,
 a new function execution context is created. Each function has
  its own execution context, which includes its local 
  variables, function arguments, and a reference to the outer
   environment (the lexical environment in which the function was defined).

 3.Variable Environment:-   The variable environment is a component of the execution 
   context that contains all variable declarations, function declarations, and 
   function arguments. It sets up the initial scope and allows variable and function 
   hoisting, making variables accessible even before they are declared.


4. Scope Chain:-   The scope chain is created based on the lexical environment of the code.
 It determines the accessibility of variables and functions within nested scopes. 
 Each execution context has a reference to its outer environment, forming a chain
  of environments that can be traversed to resolve variable and function references.


  5.This Value:-    The this value refers to the object that the function is bound to or the
   context in which the function is called. It is determined dynamically based on how
    the function is invoked. -->
